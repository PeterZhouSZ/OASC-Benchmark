## Introduction
The Object-Aware Scanning Benchmark(OASC), which aims to facilitate quantitative evaluation of object-aware scene scanning and reconstruction, is a collection of Gazebo virtual scenes, based on existing scene dataset SUNCG[Song et al. 2017]. We select 66 appropriate human-modeled synthetic scenes which are suitable for robot autoscanning and slightly adjust them to avoid collision. The collection contains 5 scene categories, including bedroom, living room, kitchen, bathroom and office.
